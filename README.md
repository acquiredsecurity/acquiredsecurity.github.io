## Digital Forensics & Threat Hunting Cybersecurity Person

Welcome to my GitHub Pages site showcasing my cybersecurity tools, forensic utilities, and threat hunting frameworks.

## About Me

I'm a former Incident Response Consultant with extensive experience in digital forensics, threat hunting, and cybersecurity. I specialize in developing tools and frameworks for security analysts and forensic investigators to enhance their capabilities in threat detection, malware analysis, and incident response.

## Projects

### [Forensic Timeliner](https://github.com/acquiredsecurity/forensic-timeliner)
A high-speed forensic timeline creation tool for DFIR investigators to quickly combine CSV files from leading Windows forensic triage tools (EZ Tools/Kape, Axiom, Hayabusa, Chainsaw, Nirsoft). The tool produces CSV output ready for Timeline Explorer, Excel, and other analysis platforms.

### [SentinelOne STAR Rules & Threat Hunts](https://github.com/acquiredsecurity/Sentinel-One-STAR-Rules-Threat-Hunts)
A collection of custom detection rules for SentinelOne's STAR (Storyline Active Response) framework, focused on detecting command tradecraft, malware behaviors, and tactics used by ransomware operators and APT groups.

### [SentinelOne Threat Hunting & XDR Guide](https://github.com/acquiredsecurity/SentinelOne-ThreatHunting-and-XDR-Guide)
A comprehensive beginner's guide to threat hunting with SentinelOne, including dashboards and queries for analyzing processes, indicators, files, network traffic, registry changes, and more through the Skylight feature.

### [SentinelOne ThreatIntel API JSON Generator](https://github.com/acquiredsecurity/SentinelOne_ThreatIntelAPI_JSON_Generator)
A web-based tool that allows security teams to manually input Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and generate properly formatted JSON data for use with the SentinelOne API, streamlining the process of integrating threat intelligence.

### [Kapesaw](https://github.com/acquiredsecurity/kapesaw)
A specialized tool for digital forensics that enhances the capabilities of KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor) for Windows forensic investigations.

### [Malware Simulations](https://github.com/acquiredsecurity/MalwareSimulations)
A collection of simulated attacker behaviors designed to test the effectiveness of AV/EDR/XDR telemetry, helping security teams validate their detection capabilities without using actual malware.
